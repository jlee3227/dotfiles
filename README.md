# Dotfile Setup

This probably won't work for you.

Uses [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/) to manage tools + utilities and [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles.

Until I find a better way you can install by cloning this repo in your home directory and running the install script with elevated privileges.
```
cd ~
sudo install.sh
```

## To Do
Separate the extra configs for `nvim`, `zsh`, and `tmux` into separate files
