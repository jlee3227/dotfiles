# Dotfile Setup

This probably won't work for you.

[`stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dotfiles.
`unzip`
`fzf`
[`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) via `fnm` for neovim's CoC
[`golang`](https://go.dev/doc/install)
[`neovim`](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md#install-from-package) as my editor
[`fuse`](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/wiki/FUSE) to intall neovim's appimage
[`tmux and tpm`](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
[`zsh with zinit`](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit)
[`oh-my-posh`](https://ohmyposh.dev/) because powerlevel10k is no longer actively supported
